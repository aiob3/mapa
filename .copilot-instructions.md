# Workspace-specific Copilot Instructions

This repository uses **GitHub Copilot + agent-customization** heavily. To help any assistant or Copilot session behave correctly, please be aware of the following rules:

1. **Project structure & iteration governance** (see `AGENTS.md`):
   - CLI located at `src/index.ts`.
   - Use `CANON-PLAN-000` planning stop before implementation.
   - Follow READ-* contracts (core, design, contracts, HITL, trigger, sync) when making changes.

2. **Coding standards**:
   - Strict TypeScript with two‑space indent, single quotes, trailing commas.
   - Named exports preferrred; PascalCase for classes, camelCase for variables, SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE for constants.

3. **Testing and builds**:
   - Jest tests alongside implementation (`*.test.ts`).
   - Validate CLI against compiled `dist/index.js`.
   - Run `npm run build && npm run test` before PRs.

4. **Documentation scaffolding**:
   - Generated docs live in `.context`; docs hub `docs/README.md` points there.
   - Scaffolded markdown contains front matter and agent markers (`<!-- agent-update:start -->`, etc.).
   - Use `ai-context fill` for LLM‑assisted updates.

5. **Commit/PR conventions**:
   - Conventional commits with scopes matching folders.
   - Include sample output when editing scaffold templates.

6. **Copilot/agent environment**:
   - Data stored under `~/.codex/` (skills, cache) and `~/.copilot/` (IDE metadata).
   - Recommended to enable `agent-customization` and keep skills updated.

If additional repository-specific behaviour is needed later (e.g. extra prompts, helper instructions), this file is the place to record them.

## Self‑diagnostic & available helpers

This section captures a quick self‑diagnosis of the environment and lists the Copilot/agent skills that are available to a human-in-the-loop session.

### Repository rules summary
- CLI scaffolds docs/agents from `src/index.ts`.
- Follow the canonical planning stop `CANON-PLAN-000` and all `READ-*` contracts before coding.
- Keep inline conventions (TypeScript strict, two spaces, single quotes, named exports).
- Tests live next to implementation; run `npm run build && npm run test` before PRs.
- Docs use front‑matter and agent-update markers; generated assets in `.context`.
- Commit messages use Conventional Commits with appropriate scopes.

### Skills present in this profile (copilot/agent)

The following skills are installed in `~/.codex/skills` and may be invoked automatically when relevant:

- `canvas-design` – create art/posters in PNG/PDF.
- `doc` – manipulate `.docx` documents.
- `figma` and `figma-implement-design` – fetch and convert Figma nodes.
- `frontend-design` – build polished web interfaces.
- `gh-address-comments` and `gh-fix-ci` – interact with GitHub issues/PRs.
- `ls-lint` – lint filenames and directory structure.
- `md-docs` – update README.md/AGENTS.md/CONTRIBUTING.md.
- `openai-docs` – retrieve official OpenAI documentation.
- `pdf` – read/create PDF files.
- `playwright` – automate browser interactions.
- `refine-prompt` – improve LLM prompts.
- `screenshot` – take system or page screenshots.
- `security-best-practices` – perform security reviews.
- `security-ownership-map` – analyze git ownership topology.
- `speech` – text‑to‑speech generation.
- `spreadsheet` – work with spreadsheets via Python.
- `tailwind-css` – style with Tailwind and related utilities.
- `theme-factory` – style artifacts with theming.
- `transcribe` – transcribe audio files.
- `web-artifacts-builder` – create complex web artifacts.
- `work` – orchestrate large tasks and coordinate subagents.
- `yeet` – stage/commit/push/PR via GitHub CLI.

(Additional skills may exist but these are the most prominent ones in this workspace.)

### Agents

os dadNo custom agents were found in the local `.codex/skills` directory, although the infrastructure supports them via YAML config.  The only agent-related file in this repo is `agents/README.md`, which simply acts as a navigation hub pointing at `.context/agents/README.md` (the canonical playbooks).

However the `.context/agents/` folder currently contains a full suite of playbooks you can instantiate on demand.  The available personas are:

- Code Reviewer
- Bug Fixer
- Feature Developer
- Refactoring Specialist
- Test Writer
- Documentation Writer
- Performance Optimizer
- Security Auditor
- Backend Specialist
- Frontend Specialist
- Architect Specialist
- Devops Specialist
- Database Specialist
- Mobile Specialist

These playbooks are invoked by copying their contents into the chat prompt and following the usage instructions in the `agents/README.md` hub.

If new agents are added later, record their names and responsibilities here or in an agents subdirectory so the system can route tasks appropriately.
