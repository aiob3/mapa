## Raw Data Samples Repository for Pipedrive CRM

### Overview
This repository contains raw data samples extracted from the Pipedrive CRM production environment. The data samples are intended for testing, analysis, and development purposes. They provide insights into the structure and content of the data stored in Pipedrive CRM, allowing users to understand, plan, and build upon the data model and relationships between different entities using atomic data samples, create data dictionaries, and document the data structure and relationships (like idempotent data samples, data dictionaries, and documentation of data structure and relationships).

### Data Extraction Process
1. **Data Extraction**: Use a data extraction tool to connect to the Pipedrive CRM production environment and extract raw data samples. Ensure that the extraction process adheres to data privacy and security guidelines.
2. **Data Sampling**: Use a data sampling tool to select representative samples of the extracted data. This may involve selecting specific time periods, filtering by certain criteria, or randomly sampling records to ensure a diverse and comprehensive dataset.
3. **Data Cleaning**: Use a data cleaning tool to remove any sensitive information, duplicates, or irrelevant data from the samples. This step is crucial to ensure that the data is suitable for testing and analysis while maintaining privacy and security.
4. **Data Validation**: Use a data validation tool to ensure that the cleaned data samples are accurate, complete, and consistent. This may involve checking for missing values, validating data types, and ensuring that the data adheres to the expected format and structure.
5. **Data Storage**: Use a data storage tool to securely store the cleaned and validated data samples. This may involve using a database, cloud storage, or a version control system to manage and organize the data samples effectively.
6. **Data Documentation**: Use a data documentation tool to create comprehensive documentation for the data samples, including data dictionaries, descriptions of the data structure and relationships, and any relevant metadata. This documentation will help users understand the context and content of the data samples and facilitate their use in testing and analysis.
7. **Data Analysis and Visualization**: Use data analysis and visualization tools to explore the data samples, identify patterns, and gain insights into the structure and content of the Pipedrive CRM data. This may involve creating charts, graphs, and other visualizations to represent the data and its relationships effectively.
8. **Data Sharing**: Use a data sharing tool to share the cleaned and documented data samples with relevant stakeholders, such as developers, analysts, and other team members. Ensure that the sharing process adheres to data privacy and security guidelines, and that access to the data samples is appropriately controlled and monitored.
9. **Data Security and Governance**: Use data security and governance tools to implement measures to protect the data samples from unauthorized access, breaches, and misuse. This may involve implementing access controls, encryption, and monitoring mechanisms to ensure the security and integrity of the data samples. Additionally, establish data governance policies and procedures to ensure that the data samples are used responsibly and in compliance with relevant regulations and standards.
10. **Data Quality and Integration: Use data quality and integration tools to ensure that the data samples are of high quality and can be effectively integrated with other datasets or systems. This may involve implementing data quality checks, resolving data inconsistencies, and ensuring that the data samples can be easily integrated with other data sources for testing and analysis purposes.
11. **Data Transformation**: Use data transformation tools to convert the data samples into the desired format or structure for specific testing or analysis needs. This may involve transforming the data into a different schema, aggregating data, or creating derived fields to facilitate specific analyses or testing scenarios.
